# supercon-2023-badge-enclosure
This is an enclosure for the Hackaday Supercon 2023 / Hackaday Berlin 2024 Vectorscope badge, which appears on GitHub here:

These files are available for anybody to 3d print, modify, remix, etc. in advance of the 2023 Hackaday Superconference and Hackaday Berlin 2024 event, so that they might have an elegant enclosure for their badge.

The intention is that there will be multiple versions of this enclosure.

Basic-2 is the most basic version (The original BASIC is depreciated; it was an early revision that didn't fit together well and you shouldn't use it anymore.) It is designed as a jumping off point for more elaborate designs with a simple, clean, rounded shape that shouldn't hurt you if you are wearing it.

BASIC-2-HACKING is a double sized version that is designed to fit the badge hacking expansion board as well. There is plenty of blank space for you to add your own controls, connectors, displays, stickers, whatever, and you are encouraged with both designs to remix them for whatever your hacking/aesthetic needs are!

If you print one and come to the show, I'd really like to get a selfie with you and your version of the badge, or if you are sensitive about your picture, I could just take a selfie with your badge. It was great fun at Supercon, and I hope to see a lot of these at Berlin 2024 as well!
